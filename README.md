# Linear-Regression-Expectation

Pythagorean expectation is a way of predicting the winning percentage of a baseball team based on their runs scored and runs conceded. My goal was to create a predictive model that is an improvement upon the basic Pythagorean expectation. I succeeded in doing this by training a Linear Regression Model using data from the MLB seasons from 2003 to 2016. This model was able to predict the winning percentage of a team with 6% more accuracy than the Pythagorean expectation.
